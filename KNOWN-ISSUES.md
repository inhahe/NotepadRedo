### NullReferenceException in font live-preview across windows (defensively fixed 2026-07-17)
- **Symptom:** A `System.NullReferenceException` was logged once (crash.log, 2026-07-17 21:01)
  during `Font_Click` → `PreviewFont` → `AllOpenViews()+MoveNext()`. It was swallowed by the
  global UI-thread handler, so the app kept running.
- **Analysis:** `AllOpenViews()` enumerates `Application.Current.Windows`, and for each
  `MainWindow` calls `AllViews()`, which read `Tabs.Items`. WPF's `Window` base constructor
  registers a window into `Application.Current.Windows` *before* the derived `InitializeComponent`
  assigns the `Tabs` field, so a transiently partly-constructed window can be enumerated and
  `Tabs` observed as null. (Release-build inlining collapsed the inner iterator frame into
  `AllOpenViews+MoveNext`, which is why the stack pointed there.)
- **Fix applied:** `AllViews()` now returns an empty sequence when `Tabs is null` instead of
  dereferencing it. See `MainWindow.xaml.cs` `AllViews()`.
- **Status:** Not deterministically reproduced. If it recurs, capture the exact repro (multi-window
  tear-off + font preview timing) and revisit whether a deeper ordering fix is warranted.
